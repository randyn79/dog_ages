# dog_ages

Takes a minimum and maximum lifespan and current age of the dog in human years and the sex of the dog.  Based on this input, it takes the average human lifespan of either males or females and calculates the number of dog years that the dog ages per one human year and the approximate age of the dog in dog years.

There is nothing scientific about these calculations.  While I have always heard 7 dog years is equivalent to one human year, if we have a dog with a possible lifespan of 18 years, this would be 126 in dog years.  This script is simply taking into account the human lifespan that corresponds with a dog breed's lifespan.
